# Personal Planner & Recipe Archive
For demo purposes a live deployment of this app can be found at https://akbrauer.onrender.com/

Do be aware that since this is hosted at a free service, the server may take up to a minute to wake up from rest when the domain is first accessed. To experiment with the Personal Planner (Calendar) application's features, start a Guest Demo using the prompt at the top. This is the best way to quickly see the site's functionality.
